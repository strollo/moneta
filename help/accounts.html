			<p class="help">
				A credit card is a payment card issued to users as a system of payment. 
				It allows the cardholder to pay for goods and services based on the holder's promise to pay for them.
				The issuer of the card creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the consumer (or the user) from which the user can borrow 
				money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance to the user.
			</p>
			<p class="help">A credit card is different from a charge card: a charge card requires the balance to be paid in full each month.
			In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. 
			A credit card also differs from a cash card, which can be used like currency by the owner of the card. 
			A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.</p>
